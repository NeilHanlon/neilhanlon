# Hi, I’m Neil Hanlon 👋

DevOps / Network / Potato Engineer. I work on open source infrastructure projects, and I care deeply about building resilient systems and sustainable communities.

These days, I spend most of my time with [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org), helping lead infrastructure and release engineering efforts for the RESF. I’m also active in the [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Neil), EPEL, and OpenStack communities, especially around packaging, automation, and making things just work™.

I like distributed systems, reproducible builds, and using chaos to find clarity.

When I’m not shipping Linux bits or untangling PKI nightmares, I might be writing (see: [thepotato.tech](https://thepotato.tech)) or hanging out with my cat, [Noella](https://instagram.com/noellathekitty). Don’t @ me.

I am also available for interesting consulting work: https://shrugpw.com

I work at the intersection of open source infrastructure, automation, and community systems.

## Values & Sustainability

Open source isn’t just code. It’s labor, community, and a whole lot of invisible glue. I care about making open infrastructure sustainable... not just technically, but socially and emotionally too.

I'm working to balance impact with burnout, and I'm trying to be honest about what I can take on. If you're here because I ghosted a bug or review, thank you for your patience.

## Things I'm Scaling Back

Because I’ve historically said "yes" to too many things (and then tried to juggle them all), I’m actively reducing my load to focus on what matters most.

If you're reaching out about a project, SIG, or package I’ve been involved with, please know that I may no longer be active there. I’m happy to point you in the right direction if I can.

## 💸 What does sponsorship support?

Your contributions support:

* Coffee ☕

In roughly that order.

Thanks for helping me keep the lights on and the build systems humming.
