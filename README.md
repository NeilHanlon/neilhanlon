# Hello

I’m Neil Hanlon, a DevOps/Network/Potato Engineer

I love Open Source, Linux, and building cool things with great people.

Feel free to take a peek at some of my projects, or check out my cat’s [Instagram](https://instagram.com/noellathekitty) (don't @ me).

## Projects

I'm currently working on Rocky Linux and projects relating to and around the Enterprise Linux space. I have a wide range of interests and like to stretch my mind into new places to learn more things and expand my knowledge.

I also am writing a book on Linux Administration with a colleague and will be sharing all the resources in the Open Source environment.

In that order

## Sponsor me, if you want
